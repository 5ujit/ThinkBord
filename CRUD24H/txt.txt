Hello Team Sagar Defence Engineering,

My name is **Shlok Srivastava**, and I am a B.Tech student ( lovely professinal university ). I am writing to apply for an opportunity at Sagar Defence Engineering .

Your organisation had previously visited my college, and I was among the candidates who appeared for the interview in the final round. ( i was the oone that day i am the one who had lsat person i had taken last persn inerview Since then, I have remained very interested in Sagar Defence, as the company’s work and values strongly align with my personal goals.

I come from an **Army background** and have spent most of my life living in **cantonment environments**, surrounded by discipline, responsibility, and a strong sense of national service. Growing up in such an environment developed a deep respect for the defence ecosystem and created a keen desire in me to contribute to the nation.

Although circumstances did not allow me to serve directly in the Armed Forces, I firmly believe that contributing through **defence technology and innovation** is a meaningful way to serve the country. The work being done at Sagar Defence Engineering gives me that opportunity.

I am particularly drawn to your organisation because of its **training-oriented and growth-focused environment**. I am always open to learning, adapting to new challenges, and continuously improving my skills. With proper internship or training exposure, I am confident that I can grow into a valuable contributor through hard work, discipline, and a strong learning attitude.

I would also like to mention that I am **fully comfortable relocating to Pune or any other location**, as required.

I would be grateful for the opportunity to be considered for any **training, internship, or entry-level role** suitable for my profile. Please find my resume attached for your reference.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,
**Shlok Srivastava**
